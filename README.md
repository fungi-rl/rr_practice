## What to include in README.md file
* Title and abstract of manuscript/project
* Provide directory (files and brief description of project with comment "#")
* Software dependencies and versions
* Instructions on how to enter project
* Description of data source and project, and where you've presented

## What to include in repository 
* Raw data
* Separate directories for code, data, figures, tables, documents
* * No spaces in directory names
  * Be descriptive
  * Be consistent
  * Maybe go with snake_case because it's easiest to read
  * nouns = variables, verbs = functions, logicals = questions
 
## Think about generating a style guide for my scripts (and eventually, my lab)
* Don't use setwd(), run from project directory
